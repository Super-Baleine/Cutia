# Cutia
:heart_decoration: An uncomplicated protocol for encrypted messaging ~ :heart_decoration:

This is a protocol for the crypto side only, I didn't designed any application authentication system or anything of this kind.

# They neutral
Sorry, I've been using "his" because the They Neutral isn't very recognized by everybody. Sorry women, but keep fighting! :D

# LaTex
I've used [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com), just copy the LaTex file and past it into a new .tex sheet in this webapp, it'd do well.

# Me
I'm not at all a cryptography expert, so don't use this protocol if you're looking for a highly secure messaging protocol.

# Figures
It's way too much boring to make... I hadn't the motivation, sorry x)

But if you want to make the figures for this whitepaper, go ahead! ~
