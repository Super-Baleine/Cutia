THIS PROTOCOL IS STILL A DRAFT, EVERYTHING'S ISN'T FINISH YET, THERE ARE SEVERAL ELEMENTS I'D LIKE TO ADD.

\section{Introduction}
This paper aims to explain Cutia, a simple protocol comprehensive by everyone.

\section{Motivations}
I thought about this protocol because I was bored to see that all encrypted messaging protocol are always using SRP, HMAC, DH, and other things that aren't easy to understand for people who would like to design an encrypted messaging service. So I thought designing a protocol with AES and RSA only would be funny to do.

\section{Terms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Session}:
    Generic term used to talk about either a Conversation Session or a Group session.
    \item \textbf{Conversation Session ($CS$)}:
    A conversation session between two users.
    \item \textbf{Group Session ($GS$)}:
    A conversation session between more than users.
    \item \textbf{Key Agreement key ($KAK$)}:
    4096-bit asymmetric pair of RSA keys generated at the client-side.
    \item \textbf{Private Key ($PKA$)}:
    Used to decrypt the $SK$ of a $CS$. It is a part of the $KAK$.
    \item \textbf{Public Key ($PKB$)}:
    Used to encrypt the $SK$ of a $CS$ before exchanging it. It is a part of the $KAK$.
    \item \textbf{Session Key ($SK$)}:
    256-bit symmetric key used to encrypt and decrypt messages in a Session. It is generated at the client-side.
    \item \textbf{Passphrase ($P$)}:
    User's defined alphanumeric UTF-8 passphrase during registration on the client side.
    \item \textbf{Key Encryption Key ($KEK$)}:
    256-bit symmetric key used to encrypt the user's $PAK$.
    \item \textbf{Key derivation function}:
    Every derivation function is performed with PBKDF2. We denote this process as $KDF(x, s, i)$, where x is the passphrase, s the Salt, and i is the strengthen by factor and always equals 7000.
    \item \textbf{Symmetric Encryption function}:
    Every symmetric encryption is performed with AES under the Galois/Counter mode on 128-bit block cipher. We denote this process as $EncSym(k, x, i, t)$, where k is the symmetric key, x is the content to be encrypted, i is the initialization vector, and t is the authentication tag.
    \item \textbf{Symmetric Decryption function}:
    Every symmetric decryption is performed with AES under the Galois/Counter mode on 128-bit block cipher. We denote this process as $DecSym(k, x, i, t$, where k is the symmetric key, x is the encrypted content to be decrypted, is is the initialization vector, and t is the authentication tag.
    \item \textbf{Asymmetric Encryption function}:
    Every asymmetric encryption is performed with RSA. We denote this process as $EncAsym(k,x)$, where $k$ is a public key and $x$ is the content to be encrypted.
    \item \textbf{Asymmetric Decryption function}:
    Every asymmetric decryption is performed with RSA. We denote this process as $DecAsym(k, x)$, where $k$ is a private key and $x$ is the content to be encrypted.
\end{itemize}

\section{User}
\subsection{Registration}
To register, the user has to provide a Passphrase $P$. The user's $KAK$ is generated while this one is registering. The $PKA$ has to be encrypted before being sent to the server. $PKB$ is sent to the server and stored in plain text.
\subsubsection{$P$ derivation}
Once the user's Passphrase $P$ defined, a random Salt is generated on 128 bits. We proceed to a key derivation to obtain the user's $KEK$ such as $KEK=KDF(P, Salt, 7000)$.
\subsubsection{Storage \& Encryption of $PKA$}
The user's $PKA$ has to be encrypted before being sent to the server. A random initialization vector (IV) and authentication tag (AT) are randomly generated on 128 bits. We proceed to the encryption of $PKA$ as $EncSym(KEK, PKA, IV, AT)$. Once encrypted, the encrypted $PKA$ is sent to the server with the IV, AT, and Salt.

\subsection{Connection}
Once the user authenticated in the system of the application, the client gets the user's KEK cryptographic parameters and also gets the $KAK$. The user types his Passphrase $P$.
\subsubsection{$P$ derivation}
The $KEK$ cryptographic parameters are the initialization vector (IV), the authentication tag (AT), and the Salt. We proceed to the derivation of the user's Passphrase $P$ such as $KEK=KDF(P, Salt, 7000)$.
\subsubsection{$PKA$ decryption}
From the $KAK$ we get the $PKA$ and decrypt it such as $DecSym(KEK, PKA, IV, AT)$.

\section{Paranoiac mode}
This mode is a $CS$ that doesn't support more than one device of every user and doesn't support any history. $SK$ is stored in the device, but isn't sent to the server.
\subsubsection{$SK$ exchange}
$SK$ is generated by one of the two participants (users) of the $CS$. The user's client that generated $SK$ gets the other user's $PKB$ and encrypt $SK$ under $PKB$ such as $EncAsym(PKB, SK)$. Once $SK$ encrypted, it is sent to the other user.
\subsubsection{Message Encryption}
For every message are generated an initialization vector (IV) and an authentication tag (AT), both are generated on 128 bits. Every message are encrypted by the Symmetric encryption function such as $EncSym(SK,message,Iv, AT)$. Once the message encrypted, we encapsulate the encrypted message $EM$ and the cryptographic parameters such as $m=(EM||IV||AT)$.

\subsubsection{Message Decryption}
The client gets the newly arrived message. From $m$ it extracts the encrypted message $EM$, the IV and the AT. The client proceeds to a symmetric decryption to get the plain text message $M$ such as $M=DecSym(SK, EM, IV, AT)$.
